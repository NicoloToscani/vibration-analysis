# Vibration Analysis for Predictive Maintenance
## Predictive maintenance
The goal is to identify and predict failures in rotating machinery using high frequency vibration data to classify its behavior as normal or anomalous and generating alerts.

## Goals
The goals of the project are: 

- Compare monitored values with the "ISO" standard;
- Create a model using differents machine learning techniques;

### ISO 10816
ISO 10816 provides guidance for evaluating vibration velocity severity motors, pumps, fans, compressors, gear boxes, blowers, dryers, presses and other machines that operate in the 10 to 1000 Hz frequency range.
